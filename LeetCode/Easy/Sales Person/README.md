Started with the nested query first
```
 select s.name
    from SalesPerson s
        left join Orders o on s.sales_id = o.sales_id
        left join Company c on o.com_id = c.com_id
    where c.name = \'Red\'
```
This queried all salespersons who is associated with the company Red
Then, I added the `NOT IN ` Where condition:

```
select s.name
from SalesPerson s
where s.name not in
    (select s.name
    from SalesPerson s
        left join Orders o on s.sales_id = o.sales_id
        left join Company c on o.com_id = c.com_id
    where c.name = \'Red\')
```
